	<h3> About me </h3>
		<p>
		<p> Hello everyone, I am Roland. I am majoring in Software Application Development and Human Computer Interaction at <a href="https://www.mercer.edu/ "target= "_blank"> Mercer Univeristy </a></p>
			After college I entered the United States Army as a officer, embarking on an active-duty career that spanned eight years.
			 During this time, I undertook several significant training programs, including Airborne School, Ranger School, and the Army Reconnaissance Course.
		<p>I reside in Georgia, sharing my life with my wife and our faithful canine companion Zelda.
			 In my free time I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, build Gundam models, and play video games.<p>
		<p> I can be contacted at 11051070@live.mercer.edu </p>
