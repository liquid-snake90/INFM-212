	<h3> About us</h3>
		<p> My wife Sara was born in Little Rock, Arkansas. Her Mom is from Costa Rica, and her Dad is from Panama.
Her Mom and Dad live in Little Rock, but their families are still in their respective countries. After our engagement, I had the opportunity to meet both of the families in Panama.
Only a little is known from My wife's side of the family, as her Mom was adopted in Costa Rica and met my wife's father in Columbia.
Her father's side has a rich history in Panama. They lived in Columbia until the 1980s when her grandfather moved to Texas.
Once her dad was 18, he joined the Navy and eventually met my wife's Mom.
Several years later, they married, moved to Little Rock, and my wife was born.
Pictured above are My wife, her Mom, and her brother. Also pictured below is myself with her Dads side of the family.
