	<h3> About us</h3>
		<p> I come from a military family where both my parents served in the Navy; due to this, I have lived all over the world. To this day, I consider Oklahoma City home.
My parents were both retired Naval Officers and met while stationed in Japan. I was born along with my two brothers and sister in Florida.
My father's family is originally from St. Louis, whereas my Mom's side is from Miami. They are pictured above.
During our annual Family vacation, we enjoy each other's company. The photo above shows my wife and I and my family at Disney World.
I have a picture of some of my cousins playing golf below.
